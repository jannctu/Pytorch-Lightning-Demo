# Pytorch-Lightning Demo 

My recent projects using [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)

PyTorch Lightning is a lightweight machine learning framework that handles most of the engineering work, leaving you to focus on the science.
This wrapper is a useful tool to do research on deep learning.
